What is WSGI?
=============

WSGI is the Web Server Gateway Interface. It is a specification for web
servers and application servers to communicate with web applications
(though it can also be used for more than that). It is a Python standard,
described in detail in :pep:`333`.

For more, see :doc:`Learn_WSGI`.
