This project is a port of the wsgi.org website from its current wiki
to Sphinx.

The port was decided by Graham Dumpleton for the following reasons:

* Hard to manage amounts of spam on the original wiki requiring
  serious wasting of time by anybody willing to clean it up

* Ability to host wsgi.org on ReadTheDocs and better interoperate with
  the Python community (e.g. InterSphinx)

* Chances for more and better contributions by providing a more
  familiar environment with little to no additional requirements for
  potential contributors
