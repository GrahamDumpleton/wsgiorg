  a WSGI test app showing whether your WSGI environment is working
  (and also outputs some interesting informations like Python version,
  sys.path, WSGI environment, etc.). It can be directly used for
  mod_wsgi and easily for all other WSGI servers. When started
  directly from command line, it tries to use wsgiref's simple server
  to serve the application.
